Lighthouse 9 Brand Typology
***************************


This document is meant to provide a clean and clear description of
the system of typology we use in our Discord community.

Socionics is constructed from simple principles.

Armed with those principles, and a little bit of history, you'll be
ready to join us in learning more about human cognition and how the
socion fits together. Please bring all your questions, comments,
criticisms, and insights, to our server. We'd love to discuss them
with you! https://discord.gg/eswQ86h

What is Socionics?
==================

Socionics is a personality typology founded by `Aušra
Augustinavičiūtė <Augusta_>`__ (commonly known as Aushra Augusta) in
1968, and developed over the course of the next few decades.

Her work is based primarily upon the foundation laid by `Carl Jung
<Jung_>`__'s theory of psychological types, which he first described
as "a critical appartus serving to sort out the welter of empirical
material". In other words, a means of explaining fundamental
differences in worldview, theory, and philosophy between different
"types" of people.

You may already be familiar with the `Myers-Briggs Type Indicator
<MBTI_>`__, or MBTI, which also used Jung's work as a seed for its
development. Socionics and the MBTI were actually designed
independently and simultaneously in completely separate parts of the
world! We believe that the fact that they share many concepts between
them is a testament to each system's earnest attempts at an accurate
picture of human nature, or natures, as the case may be.

Augusta's typology also incorporates `Antoni Kępiński
<Kępiński_>`__'s theory of information metabolism into its base
principles, which provides a systematic precision to Jung's initial
observations that helps to give socionics its unique flavor in the
world of typology. As the domain of psychology is expanded in the
modern era, socionists find more and more of these cognitive theories
that can help to confirm and refine our observations.

Socionics gets its name from the idea that every personality type has
an important role in society, or the "socion". Various schools of
socionics and philosophy in the world today explore these roles and
how groups and individuals of different type relate to each other.


.. _dichotomy:

What are Dichotomies?
=====================

A **dichotomy** (also **duality**) is a division between two
contrasting halves. Light and dark, hot and cold, and dry and wet are
some examples of physical dichotomies. In socionics, at various
levels of the psyche, we divide things into two contrasting halves,
just as Jung first did when he identified the traits of extraversion
and introversion.

Simple principle, right?

While many of the dichotomies we use are tried and true, not all of
them are as well described as they could be. Some may be too general,
others too specific, and some may be completely off base! It is one
of our jobs as socionics researchers to find more accurate
descriptions for our dichotomies, so that our typology does the best
service to the world that it possibly can. If a dichotomy doesn't fit
someone properly, consider that something about it may be incorrect,
and that it may be in need of revision.

In a mathematically sound group, there will always be one less
dichotomy than there are members of that group. The `16 types <type
descriptions_>`__ have 15 `type dichotomies <tier 1 dichotomies_>`__,
the 8 `information elements`_ have 7 `information element
dichotomies`_, and any set of 4 `small groups`_ has 3 associated
dichotomies that define it.


.. _tetrachotomy:

What are Tetrachotomies?
========================

While dichotomies are divisions of a whole into two parts,
**tetrachotomies** are a division into four parts. As mentioned in
the tail end of the last section, tetrachotomies can always be
defined by three distinct dichotomies, since every tetrachotomy is
composed of four members.

Tetrachotomies are extremely useful in socionics research because
conclusions about any two of their three dichotomies MUST be checked
against the third dichotomy for accuracy. Irrational extraverts MUST
also be static, and rational extraverts MUST be dynamic. You don't
have to worry about remembering those details all at once, we'll
review many essential tetrachotomies later on.


Jungian Foundation
==================

`Carl Jung <Jung_>`__, in his 1921 book :title:`Psychological Types`,
outlined the fundamentals of his prototypical psychological typology.
Based upon both his extensive experience with the human psyche in
his clinical practice and his rich knowledge of historic literature,
the work itself is something to behold long after its publication.

We encourage that modern practicioners of Jungian typology acquaint
themselves with at least one or two of its chapters in order to
better understand the roots of the systems in which they immerse
themselves. In particular, becoming familiar with Jung's original
conception of extraversion and introversion is essential in wielding
a Jungian typology without bias from modern definitions promulgated
by pop culture and taken up by other studies of psychology.
