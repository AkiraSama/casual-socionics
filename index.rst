What is Socionics?
==================

Socionics is a system of typology_ founded by
`Aušra Augustinavičiūtė <Augusta_>`__ (commonly Aushra Augusta,
or just A. A.) in the '70s. If you have no idea how to pronounce
her name, you are not alone.

Socionics is influenced heavily by `Carl Jung <Jung_>`__'s theories
of psychological types, and builds upon his proposed `"psychic
functions" <psychic functions_>`__: processes of the mind which recieve
input and generate output based upon their particular needs and
desires (or *agendas*). Using these functions, Socionists can build
`models <The Models_>`__ of the psyche that describe both individual
behavior and the behaviors of different types of people interacting
with each other. Identifying and describing the role of each type in
society are in essence the driving principles behind socionics.
Hence the name.


Psychic Functions
=================

The psychic functions are generally referred to as **information
elements** in socionics literature. You may also see **IM elements**,
for "Information Metabolism" elements. This is the technically
correct name for them when used in `model A`_, the information
metabolism model that is most essential to socionics.

All that being said, in *casual* socionics discussion, the psychic
functions are frequently referred to simply as "functions". This text
will refer to them as **psychic functions** explicitly in order to
math to this expectation while also avoiding ambiguity with other
model A terminology.

The four original categories of psychic function proposed by Jung_
are sensation and intuition (`perceiving <functions-jp_>`__), and
thinking and feeling (`judging <functions-jp_>`__). If you're coming
from a discipline like the MBTI_ these names probably already sound
familiar. In socionics these four **domains** (or **macroelements**)
are |sensing|_, |intuition|_, |logic|_, and |ethics|_ on an
official basis. However, as with "functions" and "elements", the
terms are somewhat interchangeable in casual discussion.

The psychic domains are further divided into our eight essential
functions across the line of `extraversion and introversion
<functions-ei_>`__, ultimately yielding...

===================== ============ ========= =============== =============

You may be wondering where the funky shapes and random words came
from. The information metabolism symbols are helpful to know for
certain older representations, but are difficult to use in
conversation (for obvious reasons), so a casual socionist won't have
much use for them. The single letter notation was proposed by `Doctor
Viktor Gulenko <Gulenko_>`__, and while they haven't really caught on
with the broader community, remembering them can be useful in quickly
recalling the traits of each individual function. We'll talk a lot
more about Dr. G later on.

Psychic Function Dichotomies
----------------------------

You're probably itching to get to the psychic functions themselves, so
what's the hold up?! Before we get to the pièce de résistance we're
going to quickly cover a few important psychic function
**dichotomies**: lines across which we can split the psychic functions
symmetrically\ |---|\ half on one side, half on the other.

The first two dichotomies are particularly important in understanding
some type notations.

.. note::
   There are other psychic function dichotomies besides the four
   listed here, but we won't cover them because they aren't generally
   useful in casual study. (Many socionists do not consider them
   useful at all.)

Judging and Perceiving
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As briefly mentioned before, this dichotomy splits up the four
domains into two groups. The two **judging** psychic functions, logic
and ethics, *judge* incoming information and relate it to previous
experience. The way they process information might be described as
*rigid* and *consistent*. The two **perceiving** psychic functions,
sensing and intuition, *percieve* incoming information and use it as
it is, without relating it to previous experience. The way they
process information might be described as *flexible* and
*spontaneous*.

Judging and perceiving are the original names for this dichotomy
identified by Jung_, and are important to know when interacting with
typologists from other Jungian disciplines. The more common names
among socionists are **rational** and **irrational**, respectively.
The rational psychic functions, in the process of judging
information, consider it rationally based on previous experience.
The irrational psychic functions, in the process of perceiving
information, do not consider it rationally, and use it without the
aid of previous experience.

(Additional alternative names that are not very useful are
**shizotyme** and **cyclotyme**, and **rigid** and **labile**.)

.. _functions-ei:

Extraversion and Introversion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This was the dichotomy that we used to turn our four domains into
eight psychic functions. These two attitudes  were actually one of
Jung's most important discoveries, so it makes sense that they would
be so essential in breaking down the inner workings of our minds.

The psychic functions on the **extraverted** side of the dichotomy
consider information about things as they *are*, independent of their
relationship with other things. At first glance this may sound much
like the description the perceiving dichotomy, which does not relate
incoming information to past experience. Ignoring relationships
between objects and ideas, and ignoring relationships between new
data and old data, should be considered distinct. The former is
extraversion, and the latter is perceiving.

The psychic functions on the **introverted** side of the dichotomy
consider information about things as they relate to other things.
Once again, analyzing relationships between objects and ideas
distinguishes introversion from judging, which relates new data to
old data in order to make judgements.

Extraversion and introversion do not have any other special names.
