What is Socionics?
==================

Socionics is a system of typology_ founded by
`Aušra Augustinavičiūtė <Augusta_>`__ (commonly Aushra Augusta,
or just A. A.) in the '70s. If you have no idea how to pronounce
her name, you are not alone.

Socionics is influenced heavily by `Carl Jung <Jung_>`__'s theories
of psychological types, and builds upon his proposed `"psychic
functions" <functions_>`__: processes of the mind which recieve
input and generate output based upon their particular needs and
desires (or *agendas*). Using these functions, Socionists can build
`models <The Models_>`__ of the psyche that describe both individual
behavior and the behaviors of different types of people interacting
with each other. Identifying and describing the role of each type in
society are in essence the driving principles behind socionics.
Hence the name.

Psychic Functions
=================

The psychic functions are generally referred to as **information
elements** in socionics literature. You may also see **IM elements**,
for "Information Metabolism" elements. This is the technically
correct name for them when used in `model A`_, the information
metabolism model that is most essential to socionics.

All that being said, in *casual* socionics discussion, the psychic
functions are frequently referred to simply as "functions". This text
will refer to them as **psychic functions** explicitly in order to
math to this expectation while also avoiding ambiguity with other
model A terminology.

The four original categories of psychic function proposed by Jung_
are sensation and intuition (`perceiving <functions-jp_>`_), and
thinking and feeling (`judging <functions-jp_>`_). If you're coming
from a discipline like the MBTI_ these names probably already sound
familiar. In socionics these four **domains** (or **macroelements**)
are **sensing**, **intuition**, **logic**, and **ethics** on an
official basis. However, as with "functions" and "elements", the
terms are somewhat interchangeable in casual discussion.

The psychic domains are further divided into our eight essential
functions across the line of `extraversion and introversion
<functions-ei_>`_, ultimately yielding...
