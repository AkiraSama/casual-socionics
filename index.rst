What is Socionics?
==================

Socionics is a psychological typology founded by `Aušra
Augustinavičiūtė <Augusta_>`__ (commonly Aushra Augusta,
or just A.A.) in the '70s. If you have no idea how to pronounce
her name, you are not alone.

Her work is based primarily upon the foundation laid by `Carl Jung
<Jung_>`__'s theory of psychological types, which he first designed
as "a critical apparatus serving to sort out and organize the welter
of empirical material." In other words, a means of explaining
fundamental differences in worldview, theory, and philosophy between
different "types" of people.

Augusta's typology also incorporates `Antoni Kępiński
<Kępiński_>`__'s theory of information metabolism, which provides a
systematic precision to Jung's initial observations that helps to
give socionics its unique flavor in the world of typology.

Socionics gets its name from the idea that every personality type
has an important role in society, or the "socion". Various schools
of socionics and philosophy in the world today explore these roles
and how groups and individuals of different type relate to each other.

Some people criticize socionics as an "overly complex" approach to
typology, but it is in reality built upon extremely simple
principles. These simple principles yield a large *volume* of
information, which may seem intimidating, but please do not dismiss
it out of hand.


.. _dichotomy:

What are Dichotomies?
=====================

A **dichotomy** (also **duality**) is a division into two contrasting
halves. Light and dark, hot and cold, and dry and wet are some
examples of physical dichotomies. In socionics, at various levels of
the psyche, we divide things into two well-researched halves, just as
Jung first did when he identified the traits of extraversion and
introversion.

Simple principle, right?

While dichotomies are just two extremes of a dimension,
it is a frequent observation that individuals will still lie
conceretely in one discrete half of the essential dichotomies, and
not the other, based on their behavior over a long period of time.
There is no one individual perfectly in the middle of any dimension
(although if you believe you are we would certainly love to see it
in action).

The last thing to be aware of about dichotomies is that,
mathematically, there's always one less dichotomy than there are
members of a group for that group. The 16 types have 15 `type
dichotomies`_, the 8 `information elements`_ have 7 `information
element dichotomies`_, and any 4 members of a set of `small groups`_
have 3 associated dichotomies that define them.


What are Tetrachotomies?
========================

Where dichotomies are divisions of a whole into two parts,
**tetrachotomies** are a division into four parts. As mentioned in
the tail end of the last section, because tetrachotomies have four
members they can always be defined by three distinct dichotomies.


This principle is useful in statistical research at various levels,
since conclusions about two dichotomies in tetrachotomy research
must be "verified" by the third remaining dichotomy.
